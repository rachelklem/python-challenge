# python-challenge

# used this code as a guide for PyBank
# https://github.com/juluobruce/Pybank-Pypoll-Hw-Challenge-/blob/master/PyBank/pybank.py
  # most lines copied directly and rewritten as I gained understanding of how the code works
  # can show many, many failed rough drafts
# attended bonus!class session on 4/1
  # much of the code in PyPoll was generated there
